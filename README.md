# AI/ML Engineering: Learning Journey & Portfolio

üëã Welcome to my public portfolio. This repository documents my structured, project-based journey to transition into AI Engineering, leveraging a fully cloud-native workflow.

## üöÄ Overview

- **My Goal:** To build a deep, practical understanding of machine learning by shipping production-ready, end-to-end AI systems.
- **My Approach:** A 4-month, intensive learning plan focused on building a sophisticated capstone project from the ground up.
- **My Stack:** This entire journey is executed on a **Chromebook**, utilizing a 100% cloud-based development environment (GitHub Codespaces, Google Colab, Hugging Face Spaces).

## üìÖ Learning Plan: A Project-Based Roadmap

A high-level overview of my hands-on learning path. Each phase builds towards a comprehensive capstone project.

### **Phase 1: Foundations & Data Mastery**
- **Focus:** Mastering the data science stack (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn) and core ML concepts through practical application.
- **Key Outcomes:** Proficiency in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and building classical ML models.
- **Project:** [`Exploratory Data Analysis`]() | [`API Data Ingestion`]()

### **Phase 2: Deep Learning & NLP**
- **Focus:** Building and training neural networks with PyTorch and fine-tuning transformer models with Hugging Face.
- **Key Outcomes:** Ability to implement and fine-tune deep learning models for computer vision and NLP tasks.
- **Project:** [`Image Classifier`]() | [`NLP Text Classifier`]()

### **Phase 3: MLOps & System Integration**
- **Focus:** Transitioning from models to production systems. Building APIs with FastAPI, containerization with Docker, and implementing CI/CD.
- **Key Outcomes:** Skills in model deployment, containerization, and creating automated ML pipelines.
- **Project:** **Capstone: Support Ticket Triage Agent** (See below)

## üìÇ Capstone Project: Intelligent Support Ticket Triage Agent

This end-to-end system is the central artifact of my learning journey, designed to demonstrate a full range of AI engineering skills.

| Component | Description | Tech Stack | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Classification Model** | A fine-tuned Transformer model for classifying ticket urgency and category. | `PyTorch`, `Hugging Face Transformers` | `Complete` |
| **2. Prediction API** | A containerized FastAPI service that provides model predictions. | `FastAPI`, `Docker` | `In Progress` |
| **3. Agentic Workflow** | An intelligent agent that decides on actions based on model output. | `LangChain` | `Planned` |
| **4. CI/CD Pipeline** | Automated testing and deployment of the entire system. | `GitHub Actions` | `Planned` |
| **5. Live Demo** | The full system deployed and accessible. | `Hugging Face Spaces` | `Planned` |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Development & CI/CD:** `GitHub Codespaces`, `GitHub Actions`
- **Experimentation & Training:** `Google Colab`, `Kaggle Notebooks`
