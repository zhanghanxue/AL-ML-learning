# AI/ML Engineering Transition: Learning Journey & Portfolio

üëã Welcome to my public portfolio and learning log. This repository documents my structured 4-month plan to transition from Software Engineering to AI Engineering, leveraging a fully cloud-native workflow.

## üöÄ Overview

- **My Goal:** To become an AI Engineer by building a deep understanding of machine learning fundamentals and demonstrating the ability to ship production-ready, end-to-end AI systems.
- **My Advantage:** 5+ years of experience in full-stack development, cloud solutions (Azure), and software lifecycle management.
- **My Constraint (& Strength):** This entire journey is being executed on a **Chromebook**, utilizing a 100% cloud-based development environment.

## üìÖ Learning Plan: A 4-Month Roadmap

This is a high-level overview of my structured learning path. Each phase builds towards a comprehensive capstone project.

### **Phase 1: Foundations & Data Mastery** (Month 1)
- **Focus:** Reactivating Python, mastering the data science stack (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn), and solidifying core ML concepts.
- **Key Outcomes:** Proficiency in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building classical ML models with Scikit-learn.
- **Resources:** LearnPython.org, Python Data Science Handbook, Google ML Crash Course.

### **Phase 2: Deep Learning & NLP** (Month 2)
- **Focus:** Building and training neural networks with PyTorch, understanding Transformer architecture, and fine-tuning models with Hugging Face.
- **Key Outcomes:** Ability to implement and fine-tune deep learning models for NLP tasks.
- **Resources:** fast.ai, Hugging Face NLP Course, PyTorch Tutorials.
- **Project:** **Capstone Part 1 - Ticket Classifier:** A fine-tuned DistilBERT model to classify support tickets by category and urgency.

### **Phase 3: MLOps & System Integration** (Month 3)
- **Focus:** Transitioning from models to production systems. Building APIs with FastAPI, containerization with Docker, and implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- **Key Outcomes:** Skills in model deployment, containerization, and creating automated ML pipelines.
- **Resources:** FastAPI, Docker Docs, GitHub Actions, Hugging Face Spaces.
- **Project:** **Capstone Parts 2 & 3 - The Full Stack:** Deploying the classifier as an API and building an intelligent LangChain agent to automate ticket triage workflows.

### **Phase 4: Portfolio Polish & Interview Prep** (Month 4)
- **Focus:** Refining the final project, practicing algorithm design, and preparing for technical interviews.
- **Key Outcomes:** A polished portfolio, proficiency in problem-solving, and interview readiness.
- **Resources:** LeetCode, NeetCode, ML System Design Primer.

## üìÇ Capstone Project: Intelligent Support Ticket Triage Agent

This end-to-end system is the central artifact of my learning journey, designed to demonstrate a full range of AI engineering skills.

| Component | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Classification Model** | A fine-tuned Transformer model (DistilBERT) for classifying ticket urgency and category. | `In Progress` |
| **2. Prediction API** | A containerized FastAPI service that provides model predictions. | `Planned` |
| **3. Agentic Workflow** | A LangChain agent that decides on actions (routing, drafting responses) based on model output. | `Planned` |
| **4. CI/CD Pipeline** | Automated testing and deployment of the entire system using GitHub Actions. | `Planned` |
| **5. Live Demo** | The full system deployed and accessible on Hugging Face Spaces. | `Planned` |

## üõ†Ô∏è Cloud-Native Tech Stack

- **Development & CI/CD:** `GitHub Codespaces`, `GitHub Actions`
- **Experimentation & Training:** `Google Colab`, `Kaggle Notebooks`
- **Deployment & Demos:** `Hugging Face Spaces`, `Docker`
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** `PyTorch`, `Hugging Face Transformers`, `LangChain`, `FastAPI`, `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`

## üìà Progress Log

I update this log weekly to hold myself accountable and document my progress.

- **Week 1 (Sept XX):** Environment setup in GitHub Codespaces completed. Python refresh underway.
- **Week 2 (Sept XX):** Data manipulation with Pandas mastered. Built data ingestion script from a public API.
